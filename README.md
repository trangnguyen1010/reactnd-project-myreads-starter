# MyReads Project

## About the project

MyReads is a project that we create a bookshelf app that allow users can track and categorize books in their library. There are three shelves in the app:

- Currently Reading
- Read
- Want to Read

In the main page, three shelves are displayed with corresponding books. In the search page, it allows users search for new books to add into their store. There is a control button for each book that help users to switch the books to any shelves that they want.
